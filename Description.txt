The Data visualization helps in better understanding of the dataset
Preprocessing is done in order to facilitate in training of an accurate algorithm

A KNN model is trained on this dataset
The model is saved as a (.pkl) file 

The saved model is called in the testing code
The training code asks user for prior experience 
The input is then passed to the model 

A List of Recommended Movies is Generated and Displayed
